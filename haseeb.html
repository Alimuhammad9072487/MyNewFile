<h1>Exercises: So you want to make a web page!</h1>
</center>
<h2>Exercise 1:</h2>
<p>Make a simple page (the "My big ole bad page!" from Lesson 1 
will do nicely). Now upload it to either your personal ISP space, 
the space you've rented on a server, or one of the free web hosts...</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">my channel   </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/">  my gmail acc   </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H25po8jXitU"> my interview vid  </a></li>
</ul>


<p>(There are dozens of others floating around, but these are the
     biggies that have been around for a while.)</p>
    <p>Uploading your nifty new web page to a web server is often one 
        of the more confusing tasks for the budding web author. 
        There is no easy way to learn except to simply fumble though
         it the best you can. While the basic principle is the same,
          specific procedures can vary from person to person and host 
          to host so instructions aimed at one person may actually
           confuse another. Still, some step by step instruction would
            be nice, even if it only covers most circumstances. I've
             put together a piece called Upload Your Pages. It might
              be of some help.</p>

       <p> As I said, this is often a hurdle for people, so we're
            going to kick it first and kick it hard while we've got 
            the energy. Keep at it until you get it. The goal is to
             get the page (text only is fine for now) on the Internet
              and know the URL for it. Don't move on until you've
               tackled this exercise.</p>

<h2> Exercise 2: </h2> 
<p>Got the page up? Good. Next task is to put an image in that page
     and get it uploaded as well. You can use the smiley below.</p>
